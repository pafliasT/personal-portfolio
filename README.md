# 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a powerful and efficient tool for building React-based web applications.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Experience our application in action: [Live Demo](https://pafliast-portfolio-eight-opal.vercel.app/). This demo is hosted on Vercel, showcasing the real-time capabilities and performance of our project.

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run several scripts:

### `npm start` 🏃

- **Purpose**: Launches the app in development mode.
- **Access**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- **Features**: The page auto-reloads upon file edits. Lint errors are visible in the console.

### `npm test` 🧪

- **Purpose**: Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- **Documentation**: Learn more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build` 🏗️

- **Purpose**: Compiles the app for production to the `build` folder.
- **Performance**: Optimizes the build for best performance - minified with hashed filenames.
- **Deployment**: Ready for deployment. Check [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject` ⚠️

- **Warning**: One-way operation. Once you `eject`, there's no going back!
- **Functionality**: Removes the single build dependency, copies all config files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project.
- **Control**: Provides full control over these configurations. Post-ejection, all commands except `eject` will still function but will point to the copied scripts.
